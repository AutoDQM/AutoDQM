AutoDQM
=======

AutoDQM parses DQM histograms and identifies outliers by various
statistical tests for further analysis by the user. Its output can be
easily parsed by eye on an AutoPlotter-based html page which is
automatically generated when you submit a query from the AutoDQM GUI.
Full documentation for AutoDQM can be found on our
`wiki <http://github.com/jkguiang/AutoDQM/wiki>`__.
